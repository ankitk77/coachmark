## Getting Started

In your module's build.gradle

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.github.pseudoankit/coachmark/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.github.pseudoankit/coachmark)
```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.pseudoankit:coachmark:<latest_version🔝>'
}
```

## Usage

Define Keys for all coachmarks
```kotlin
enum class Keys { Text1, Text2 }
```

At root level make sure to wrap with UnifyCoachmark
```kotlin
UnifyCoachmark(
    tooltip = { /* Declare Tooltip Source code below ⏬ */ Tooltip(it) },
    overlayEffect = DimOverlayEffect(Color.Black.copy(alpha = .5f)),
    onOverlayClicked = { OverlayClickEvent.GoNext }
) {
    Content()     // Source code below ⏬
}
```

Enable coachmark for the required views with `enableCoachMark`, To access `enableCoachMark` you need to be inside `CoachmarkScope`
If you are not in `CoachmarkScope` then get access to it via LocalCoachMarkScope.current
```kotlin
@Composable
private fun Content() {
    with(LocalCoachMarkScope.current) {    // not needed if you are already in `CoachmarkScope`
        Text(
            text = "Will show tooltip 1",
            modifier = Modifier
                .enableCoachMark(
                    key = Keys.Text1,    // unique that we declared above
                    toolTipPlacement = placement,
                    highlightedViewConfig = HighlightedViewConfig(
                        shape = HighlightedViewConfig.Shape.Rect(12.dp),
                        padding = PaddingValues(8.dp)
                    )
                )
        )
    }
}
```

Define tooltip view (Tootip is showing when view is highlighted currently) 
```kotlin
@Composable
private fun Tooltip(key: CoachMarkKey) {
    when (key) {
        Keys.Text1 -> {
            Balloon(arrow = Arrow.Start()) {
                Text(text = "Highlighting Text1", color = Color.White)
            }
        }
    
        Keys.Text2 -> {
            Balloon(arrow = Arrow.Start()) {
                Text(text = "Highlighting Text2", color = Color.White)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
